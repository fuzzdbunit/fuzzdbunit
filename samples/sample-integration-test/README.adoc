== Sample with integration test

=== Description

This sample is based on a Quarkus sample provided by Baeldung: https://www.baeldung.com/java-quarkus-testing

To demonstrate FuzzDbUnit, we removed some tests and modified the test class `LibraryResourceHttpResourceIntegrationTest.java`
to execute an integration test with FuzzDbUnit.

See FuzzDbUnit in action with the maven command:

 ./mvnw verify
