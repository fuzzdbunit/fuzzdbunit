== Sample with Selenium test

=== Description

This sample uses Selenium to test a web application, in our case OWASP WebGoat.

=== Requirements

To run this test, you will need:

* JDK 11+
* Firefox
* Gecko driver (driver for Firefox)

You can use any browser supported by Selenium, but you have to install the corresponding driver.

=== Fuzz test

WebGoat has many examples of vulnerabilities. We fuzz test one of them, the _Dangerous use of Eval_,
to be found in _AJAX Security_ menu on the left.

To run the test, just type:

....
 ./gradlew test
....

NOTE: the test fails, which is normal and expected, since the application is not safe.
